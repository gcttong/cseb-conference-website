																		<h2>Dr. Robert Platt
																		</h2>
																		<p> Robert Platt is Professor in the departments of Pediatrics and of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health (EBOH) at McGill University, and Director of Graduate Programs in the department of EBOH. He holds the Albert Boehringer I endowed chair in Pharmacoepidemiology. Dr. Platt has been the leader of the Methods team of the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (DSEN-CNODES) since its inception. In this role he has led a methods research and training program for CNODES, and has participated as methods liaison (senior methods author) in several CNODES studies.</p>

																		<p>Dr. Platt received his PhD in Biostatistics from the University of Washington in 1996, and has been on faculty at McGill since then. His research interests are in statistical methods and applications for administrative-data pharmacoepidemiology and perinatal epidemiology, and in methods for causal inference from epidemiologic studies. His methodologic interests are in marginal structural models for analyses of large administrative-data cohorts, in particular with regard to specification and optimization of the propensity score and inverse probability weights.</p>

																		<p>Dr. Platt was the recipient of the Prix d’Excellence in 2005 from the Quebec Foundation for Research on Children’s Diseases, and holds a Chercheur-national (National research scholar) award from the Fonds de recherche en santé du Québec. He is principal investigator on a Foundation grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and a Discovery grant Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada, and co-investigator/subcontractor on multiple CIHR and NIH grants. He is Associate Editor of Statistics in Medicine, The International Journal of Biostatistics, American Journal of Epidemiology, and the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. Dr. Platt has published over 280 articles, one book, and several book chapters.</p>

															<h2>Dr. Dan Chateau  </h2>
															
															<p>Dan Chateau is a Research Scientist at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Community Health Sciences at University of Manitoba. He completed a PhD in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Western Ontario, and has conducted research at both MCHP, and as a consultant in the Biostatistics Consulting Unit in the College of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences. These positions provided a strong base in health services research and quantitative research methods. Dr. Chateau has worked on a broad range of projects for organizations as diverse as the WRHA, Manitoba Health, the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health, and the Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine, and with numerous clinicians and members of other departments at the University of Manitoba and beyond. In addition to contributing to major reports at MCHP, at present Dan is a member of the steering committee and quantitative methods team for the Canadian Network of Observational Drugs Effect Studies (CNODES), and a co-PI on a large multi-year grant investigating the effects of policies and interventions on health equity in Manitoba’s children (PATHS).</p>

															
<h2>Webinar Description:</h2>
<p>Prescription drugs constitute the most common form of treatment used in clinical practice.  Despite extensive study in pre-approval randomized controlled trials of safety and effectiveness, many questions remain unanswered about their effects, whether unintended, harmful or beneficial. In the absence of randomization, the epidemiologic approach, applied to the observational study of drug effects after their approval, lends itself naturally well to the study of the actual real-life effects of these drugs in the natural setting of clinical practice, often quite different from the experimental setting in which they were developed.</p>

<p>Scientists from various Canadian Provinces have for many years conducted epidemiological studies of drug safety and effectiveness using databases resulting from Canada’s universal health insurance programs. Yet, these individual initiatives cannot always address some new challenges that require larger databases for the study of rare and serious adverse events, for the study of drugs used for infrequent diseases, and to study medications early after they enter the market.</p>

<p>It is specifically to address these challenges that the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (CNODES) was created.  This is a pan-Canadian collaboration assembling over 60 scientists from across the country that use existing healthcare databases on over 30 million people along with powerful analytical methods, to evaluate the risks and benefits of medications. CNODES conducts studies of drug safety in a distributed network of administrative databases from seven Canadian provinces, the US, and the UK.  CNODES addresses drug safety queries by conducting similar studies in each available database, and combining the results via a pre-planned meta-analysis. </p>

<p>This webinar will describe the inner workings of CNODES, including the process for creating a uniform scientific protocol for each project, and an associated common analytic protocol.  Steps along the way that will be covered:

    <ul><li>Creating a query research group</li>
    <li>Identifying the questions that can be addressed using administrative databases</li>
    <li>Defining cohort inclusion and exclusion criteria</li>
    <li>Determining the best analytic methods for estimating treatment effects</li>
    <li>Common issues for clarification from programmer/analysts</p></li> </ul>

<p>This way of doing business has enabled CNODES to complete numerous studies of drug safety, and ensure that these high quality large scale studies can reliably be combined. 

<p>We will also describe methods issues that have been addressed, ongoing concerns for observational studies, and new approaches to meta-analysis that have been considered for studies where all results from the various jurisdictions may not arrive in a timely manner. 

	<p><strong>*Student status awarded to any of the following</strong>:

     <ul><li>Individual is currently enrolled full-time at a recognized post-secondary institution;</li>
    <li>Individual holds a post-doctoral fellowship at a recognized post-secondary institution; or</li>
    <li>Individual has recently (within the last year) graduated from a recognized post-secondary institution.</p></ul>

<p>**All proceeds from this webinar will go towards the organization of the 2016 CSEB Student Conference at the University of Manitoba.</p>
